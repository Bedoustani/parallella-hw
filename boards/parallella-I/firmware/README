This file describes how to reprogram the content of the 128Mb
QSPI boot flash on the Parallella board.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Directory Content:

parallella.flash.bin      (bootable flash image)
parallella.bit.bin	  (FPGA bitstream loaded by U-Boot from SD card)
fsbl.elf 		  (First Stage Boot Loader)
uboot.elf 		  (U-Boot executable)
stub.tcl 		  (tcl script for putting the CPU in debug mode)
ps7_init.tcl 		  (FSBL settings as tcl script for JTAG operation)

The u-boot.elf is compiled from the parallella-uboot repository using the arm
gcc compiler.

The fsbl.elf is generated from the Xilinx tool chain

The parallella fpga bit files are generated by the Xilinx tool chain.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Pre-requisites:
-Xilinx Platform USB Cable II
-Serial port console cable
-Xilinx tools installed

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Make sure you have xilinx tools installed and you have the 
    correct path set. For example:

    my-machine:~> source /opt/Xilinx/14.7/ISE_DS/settings64.csh

2.  Copy over a raw FPGA bitstream file from the fpga project directory.
    For example: "parallella-hw/fpga/projects/parallella_7020_headless"

3.  Run the Xilinx bootgen utility to create the binary file for the flash,
    An bootgen ".bif" configuration file example is given below.

    the_ROM_image:
    {
    [bootloader]/path/to/fsbl.elf
    /path/to/your/fpga-bitstream.bin
    /path/to/u-boot.elf
   }

   my-machine:~>bootgen -image /path/to/image.bif -o i parallella.bin

         
4.  Connect a console cable to the three pin serial port header and a computer.
    running a console application such as putty or tera term.

5.  Connect the Xilinx Platform USB II cable to the JTAG PEC_POWER pins. (Note
    that you will need a PEC_POWER breakout board for this). Connect the
    JTAG cable to the Linux based computer running the Xilinx software. There
    may be a driver conflict between the Xilinx cable and the serial cable so
    the safe bet is to connect the cables in step 2 and 3 to separate computers.

6.  Power on the board

7.  Start the JTAG debugger on machine connected to JTAG cable:

    my-machine:~>xmd

8.  Enter the following command sequence in XMD to run the u-boot application
    through the JTAG loader:

    XMD% connect arm hw
    XMD% source ./ps7_init.tcl
    XMD% ps7_init
    XMD% init_user
    XMD% source ./stub.tcl
    XMD% target 64
    XMD% dow u-boot.elf
    XMD% con

9.  Insert an SD card with the file called "parallella.flash.bin" on boot partition.

10.  In the serial port console program enter the following sequence:
    (Note: Takes several minutes, be patient)

    mmcinfo
    fatload mmc 0 0x4000000 parallella.flash.bin
    sf probe 0 0 0
    sf erase 0 0x1000000
    sf write 0x4000000 0 0x$filesize

11.  Power off board and take out the SD card.

12.  Set the ethernet address. The first 6 characters contain the Adapteva
assigned range of MAC-IDs. The last 6 characters should match the serial 
number ("SN") on the board sticker.

    zynq-uboot> set ethaddr 04 4F 8B 00 00 00 (for example)
    zynq-uboot> saveenv

13. Power down board

14. At this point the board is ready for general use.
